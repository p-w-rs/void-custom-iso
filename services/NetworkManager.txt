package:     NetworkManager
service:     NetworkManager
description:
  A high-level network management daemon that automatically handles wired,
  Wi-Fi, VPN, and mobile broadband connections. It provides automatic
  connection switching, roaming, and integrates with desktop applets such
  as nm-applet and network settings GUIs in GNOME, KDE, etc.

  Requires dbus to be running. Disable dhcpcd on any interface you want
  NetworkManager to manage, or conflicts will cause network instability.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/NetworkManager.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Generally no — dhcpcd or static config is simpler and more
           predictable. Use NetworkManager on a server only if you have
           a specific need (VPN management, complex bonding setups, etc.).
  Desktop: Yes, especially on laptops with Wi-Fi and VPN requirements.

conflicts:
  dhcpcd      — do not run both on the same interface.
  wpa_supplicant — NetworkManager manages wpa_supplicant internally;
                   do not run a separate wpa_supplicant service alongside it
                   on the same interface.

server: NO (prefer dhcpcd for servers)
