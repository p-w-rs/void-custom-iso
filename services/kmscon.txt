package:     kmscon
service:     kmscon (replaces getty on a TTY)
description:
  A userspace virtual terminal replacement that uses KMS (Kernel Mode
  Setting) and OpenGL to render a terminal directly on the framebuffer. It
  replaces the standard agetty/getty TTY with a GPU-accelerated terminal
  that supports Unicode, scalable fonts, and improved rendering — without
  running a full desktop environment.

  kmscon is configured per-TTY. You disable getty on a TTY (e.g. tty1) and
  replace it with kmscon. It is a niche tool for those who want a better
  TTY experience without a DE.

when_to_use:
  Server:  No — requires KMS/GPU output and a physical display.
  Desktop: Optional — only if you want a significantly better TTY experience
           and are running a minimal setup without a display manager.

conflicts:
  agetty / getty on the same TTY — you replace one with the other, not both.

server: NO
