description:
  OpenSSH provides encrypted remote login and command execution over SSH.
  The sshd daemon listens for incoming connections. It is the standard way
  to administer any remote Linux machine and is also useful on desktops if
  you ever need to log in from another device or use the machine as a jump
  host.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/sshd.
  Harden sshd_config before exposing to the internet:
    - Set PasswordAuthentication no (prefer SSH keys)
    - Consider changing Port from 22
    - Set PermitRootLogin no

when_to_use:
  Server:  Always. Enable this first before anything else.
  Desktop: Optional. Enable if you need remote access to this machine.

conflicts:
  None.

server: YES - essential
