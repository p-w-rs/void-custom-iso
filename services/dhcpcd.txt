package:     dhcpcd
service:     dhcpcd
description:
  A DHCP client daemon. Automatically configures network interfaces by
  requesting an IP address and routing info from a DHCP server. Lightweight
  and simple compared to NetworkManager. Void ships dhcpcd as its default
  network configuration tool. Works well for machines with stable, simple
  networking needs: servers, wired desktops, or any machine that does not
  need Wi-Fi roaming or VPN management via a GUI.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/dhcpcd.
  To manage a specific interface only: copy /etc/sv/dhcpcd to
  /etc/sv/dhcpcd-eth0 and add the interface name to the run script.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Yes — preferred over NetworkManager for servers.
  Desktop: Yes, if you do not need NetworkManager's features.

conflicts:
  NetworkManager — do not run both on the same interface.

server: YES
