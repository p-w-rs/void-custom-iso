package:     cronie
service:     cronie
description:
  A cron daemon that runs scheduled tasks defined in user and system
  crontabs. On Void/runit there are no built-in timer mechanisms, so a
  cron daemon is the standard way to schedule recurring jobs such as
  backups, certificate renewal (certbot), log rotation, and cleanup scripts.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/cronie.
  System crontabs live in /etc/cron.d/ and /var/spool/cron/.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Yes — needed for any scheduled automation.
  Desktop: Yes — useful for backups and maintenance scripts.

conflicts:
  dcron  — alternative cron daemon; run only one cron daemon.
  fcron  — same conflict.
  scron  — same conflict.
  tinycron — same conflict.

server: YES
