package:     elogind
service:     elogind
description:
  Standalone fork of systemd-logind for non-systemd systems. Manages user
  login sessions, seats (the collection of display/input hardware assigned
  to a local user), power/suspend/hibernate button events, and exposes the
  logind D-Bus API. Many desktop applications, display managers, polkit,
  and Wayland compositors expect this API to exist.

  On Void with runit, elogind is the recommended way to handle session and
  seat management on a desktop. It does far more than seatd alone.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/elogind.

when_to_use:
  Server:  No.
  Desktop: Yes. Enable before your display manager, compositor, or DE.

conflicts:
  seatd — both manage seats; use one or the other, not both.
  (systemd-logind is not present on Void so no conflict there.)

server: NO
