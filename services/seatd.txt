package:     seatd
service:     seatd
description:
  A minimal seat management daemon. A "seat" is the collection of hardware
  (GPU, keyboard, mouse, display) assigned to a local user session. seatd
  allows Wayland compositors to access GPU and input devices without running
  as root, by mediating device access through a Unix socket.

  On Void/runit, seatd is an alternative to elogind for pure seat management
  only. It is the right choice if you want the absolute minimum (e.g. a
  Wayland compositor on a very stripped-down system) and do not need the
  full logind D-Bus API that elogind provides. If you use a display manager
  or apps that depend on logind (polkit, most DEs), use elogind instead.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/seatd.

when_to_use:
  Server:  No.
  Desktop: Optional — only if you are not using elogind and your Wayland
           compositor supports seatd directly (e.g. sway, Hyprland, river).

conflicts:
  elogind — both manage seats; use one or the other, not both.

server: NO
