package:     polkit
service:     polkitd
description:
  A privilege management service that allows unprivileged processes to
  request elevated permissions in a controlled, policy-based way without
  requiring full sudo access. Examples: allowing a normal user to reboot,
  mount drives, manage NetworkManager connections, or install packages via
  a GUI. Many desktop environments and GUI tools silently depend on polkit.

  Requires dbus and elogind to function correctly on Void.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/polkitd.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Rarely. Only if running GUI tools or services that require it.
  Desktop: Yes — most DEs and GUI admin tools expect it.

conflicts:
  None from services in this collection. Requires dbus + elogind.

server: NO
