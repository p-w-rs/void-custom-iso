description:
  socklog-void is the Void Linux configuration package for socklog, a syslog
  implementation written by the author of runit. It provides two runit
  services:

    socklog-unix — listens on /dev/log and collects messages from daemons
                   that write to the standard syslog socket.
    nanoklogd    — captures kernel messages (equivalent of klogd).

  Together they replace journald/syslogd and write logs as plain text files
  to /var/log/socklog/ organized by facility (daemon, kernel, auth, etc.).
  Logs can be tailed with the included svlogtail utility.

  Without this (or another syslog daemon), most daemon log output is silently
  lost on a Void/runit system. This is one of the most commonly forgotten
  steps on a fresh Void install.

  After install, enable both services:
    ln -s /etc/sv/socklog-unix /var/service/
    ln -s /etc/sv/nanoklogd    /var/service/

when_to_use:
  Server:  Yes — critical. You need logs to diagnose anything.
  Desktop: Yes — highly recommended.

conflicts:
  rsyslog     — alternative syslog daemon; run only one syslog daemon.
  metalog     — same conflict.
  inetutils-syslog — same conflict.

server: YES - essential
