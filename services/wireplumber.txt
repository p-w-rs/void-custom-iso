description:
  The session and policy manager for PipeWire. PipeWire handles low-level
  audio/video routing but needs a session manager to decide how streams are
  connected — which app gets which device, device hotplug handling, routing
  rules, and Bluetooth audio profile management. WirePlumber is the standard
  recommended session manager for PipeWire.

  NOTE: This is a USER service. It has no entry in /etc/sv/ and cannot be
  enabled via -S. Enable it in your user runit session alongside pipewire
  and pipewire-pulse. PipeWire without a session manager is non-functional
  for normal desktop use.

  wireplumber-elogind (in audio-system.txt packages) is the elogind-linked
  variant and must be used when elogind is running.

when_to_use:
  Server:  No.
  Desktop: Yes — always run alongside pipewire and pipewire-pulse.

conflicts:
  pipewire-media-session — the older PipeWire session manager; run only one.

server: NO
