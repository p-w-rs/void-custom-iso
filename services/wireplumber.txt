package:     wireplumber
service:     wireplumber (user service)
description:
  The session and policy manager for PipeWire. PipeWire handles low-level
  audio/video routing but needs a session manager to decide how streams are
  connected — which app gets which device, device hotplug handling, routing
  rules, and Bluetooth audio profile management. WirePlumber is the standard
  recommended session manager for PipeWire, replacing the older
  pipewire-media-session.

  Runs as a user-level service alongside pipewire. PipeWire without a
  session manager is essentially non-functional for normal desktop use.

when_to_use:
  Server:  No.
  Desktop: Yes — always run alongside pipewire.

conflicts:
  pipewire-media-session — the older PipeWire session manager; run only one
                           session manager at a time.

server: NO
