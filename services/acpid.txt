package:     acpid
service:     acpid
description:
  The ACPI event daemon. Listens for hardware events — lid open/close,
  power button press, battery status changes, AC adapter plug/unplug —
  and executes scripts in response. Useful for defining custom behavior
  on physical hardware events, especially on laptops or home servers with
  a power button you want to handle gracefully.

  Scripts live in /etc/acpi/. Default scripts handle basic power events.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/acpid.

  Note: elogind also handles some ACPI power events (suspend on lid close,
  etc.) via logind.conf. On a full desktop with elogind, acpid may be
  redundant for basic actions but is still useful for custom scripting.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Rarely — only if you want to script behavior for the physical
           power button on a home server or bare-metal machine.
  Desktop: Yes, especially on laptops.

conflicts:
  Overlaps with elogind power event handling (lid close, power button).
  Not a hard conflict — both can run, but configure one to avoid duplication.

server: NO (unless bare-metal with physical controls you want to script)
