package:     pipewire
service:     pipewire (user service)
description:
  A modern, low-latency multimedia server that handles audio and video
  streams. Designed to replace both PulseAudio (desktop audio) and JACK
  (pro-audio), while also managing camera and video device access used by
  screen sharing under Wayland, Flatpak apps, and browser video capture.

  On Void, pipewire runs as a user-level runit service, not system-level.
  It must be paired with wireplumber (session manager) to be functional,
  and pipewire-pulse to maintain compatibility with PulseAudio applications.

  User service location: ~/.config/runit/sv/pipewire or via a user service
  manager. See Void docs for user service setup.

when_to_use:
  Server:  No — no audio/video need on a headless server.
  Desktop: Yes — the current standard for desktop audio on Void.

conflicts:
  pulseaudio — cannot run simultaneously; disable pulseaudio if present.
  jack       — pipewire replaces jack; do not run both.

server: NO
