package:     bluez
service:     bluetoothd
description:
  The BlueZ Bluetooth stack daemon. Manages Bluetooth hardware, device
  pairing and discovery, and Bluetooth profiles including audio (A2DP, HFP),
  HID (keyboards, mice), and serial devices. Exposes a D-Bus API used by
  desktop Bluetooth managers and by WirePlumber/PipeWire for Bluetooth audio.

  Requires dbus to be running. For Bluetooth audio to work, wireplumber must
  also be running as it manages the A2DP/HFP audio profiles.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/bluetoothd.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Rarely — only for specific use cases like a Bluetooth gateway,
           IoT serial device, or Bluetooth input device on a home server.
  Desktop: Yes, if you use Bluetooth devices (headphones, keyboard, mouse).

conflicts:
  None from services in this collection. Requires dbus + wireplumber for
  Bluetooth audio to function.

server: NO (unless specific Bluetooth hardware use case)
