description:
  A PulseAudio compatibility socket provided by PipeWire. Makes PipeWire
  present itself as a PulseAudio server so all PulseAudio-based apps work
  transparently without modification. This is not a separate audio server —
  it is a compatibility shim that runs as part of the PipeWire user session.

  NOTE: This is a USER service. It has no entry in /etc/sv/ and cannot be
  enabled via -S. It is provided by the same 'pipewire' package. Enable
  it alongside pipewire and wireplumber in your user runit session.

  Required any time you use PipeWire on a desktop that has PulseAudio-based
  apps (which is essentially all of them).

when_to_use:
  Server:  No.
  Desktop: Yes — always enable alongside pipewire and wireplumber.

conflicts:
  pulseaudio — both try to bind the same PulseAudio socket; disable
               pulseaudio completely before enabling pipewire-pulse.

server: NO
