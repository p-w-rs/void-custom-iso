package:     pipewire
service:     pipewire-pulse
description:
  A PulseAudio compatibility socket provided by PipeWire. It makes PipeWire
  present itself as a PulseAudio server on the standard PulseAudio socket,
  so all applications written against the PulseAudio API (which is most
  audio apps) work transparently with PipeWire without any modification.

  This is not a separate audio server — it is a compatibility shim that
  runs as part of the PipeWire user session. Required any time you use
  PipeWire on a desktop that has PulseAudio-based apps.

when_to_use:
  Server:  No.
  Desktop: Yes — always enable alongside pipewire and wireplumber.

conflicts:
  pulseaudio — both try to bind the same PulseAudio socket; only one can
               run at a time. Disable pulseaudio completely before enabling
               pipewire-pulse.

server: NO
