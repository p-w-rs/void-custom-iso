package:     chrony
service:     chronyd
description:
  A modern NTP (Network Time Protocol) daemon that synchronizes the system
  clock with internet time servers. Accurate system time is critical: wrong
  time breaks TLS certificate validation, corrupts log timestamps, and
  causes failures in cron jobs, Kerberos, and distributed systems.

  On Void there is no built-in time sync (unlike some other distros), so
  this must be installed and enabled manually.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/chronyd.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Yes — always. Enable on every machine.
  Desktop: Yes — always. Enable on every machine.

conflicts:
  openntpd — alternative NTP daemon; run only one NTP daemon at a time.
  ntpd      — same; run only one NTP daemon at a time.

server: YES - essential
