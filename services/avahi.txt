package:     avahi
service:     avahi-daemon
description:
  Implements mDNS/DNS-SD (Multicast DNS / Zeroconf / Bonjour). Allows
  devices on a local network to discover each other by hostname without
  a DNS server (e.g. reaching a machine at hostname.local). Also enables
  local network service discovery — printers, network shares, SSH hosts —
  used by CUPS, Nautilus network browsing, and other tools.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/avahi-daemon.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Optional — useful if you want to reach the server by
           servername.local on your LAN without setting up DNS.
  Desktop: Yes, if you use local network discovery (printers, file shares).

conflicts:
  None. Requires dbus.

server: OPTIONAL
