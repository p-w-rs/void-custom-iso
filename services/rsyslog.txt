package:     rsyslog
service:     rsyslogd
description:
  An enhanced, multi-threaded syslog daemon. An alternative to socklog-void
  for collecting and routing log messages from daemons and the kernel.
  rsyslog is more feature-rich and configurable than socklog, supporting
  log forwarding to remote servers, filtering, and database output. It is
  more familiar to admins coming from traditional server Linux setups.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/rsyslogd.
  Logs are written to /var/log/ by default (messages, auth.log, etc.).

when_to_use:
  Server:  Yes — a good alternative to socklog-void, especially if you
           need remote log forwarding or are familiar with rsyslog config.
  Desktop: Optional — socklog-void is simpler and runit-native.

conflicts:
  socklog-void / socklog — both bind /dev/log; run only one syslog daemon.
  metalog, inetutils-syslog — same conflict.

server: YES (alternative to socklog-void)
