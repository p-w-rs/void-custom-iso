package:     nftables runit-nftables
service:     nftables
description:
  The nftables packet filtering framework — successor to iptables. Loads
  firewall rules from /etc/nftables.conf at service start. The default
  ruleset shipped with this ISO:

    - Allows all outbound traffic.
    - Allows established/related inbound traffic (replies to your requests).
    - Allows SSH (tcp port 22) inbound.
    - Allows ICMP/ICMPv6 (ping) inbound.
    - Drops everything else inbound.

  This is a safe baseline for any internet-connected machine. Add rules to
  /etc/nftables.conf as needed (e.g. open port 80/443 for a web server)
  and restart the service: sv restart nftables

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/nftables.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Yes — critical. An SSH-exposed machine without a firewall is
           relying entirely on sshd having no vulnerabilities.
  Desktop: Yes — strongly recommended, especially on untrusted networks.

conflicts:
  iptables service — do not run both; nftables replaces iptables.

server: YES - essential
