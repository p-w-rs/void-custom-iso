package:     greetd
service:     greetd
description:
  A minimal, flexible display manager (login manager) for Wayland compositors.
  greetd handles user authentication and then launches a configured session
  command (e.g. a Wayland compositor like mangowc) as the authenticated user.

  Uses agreety as its built-in TUI greeter — prompts for username and
  password, then launches the configured session. No GUI required.

  Requires elogind and dbus to be running. The greeter system user must
  exist (created by post-setup.sh).

  Configuration lives at /etc/greetd/config.toml.
  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/greetd.

  NOTE: post-setup.sh disables agetty-tty1 and enables greetd on tty1.
  kmscon runs on tty2 as a fallback terminal (switch with Ctrl+Alt+F2).

when_to_use:
  Server:  No.
  Desktop: Yes — use this to launch your Wayland compositor on login.

conflicts:
  sddm, gdm, lightdm — run only one display manager at a time.
  agetty-tty1         — disabled by post-setup.sh in favour of greetd.

server: NO
