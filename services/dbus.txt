package:     dbus
service:     dbus
description:
  D-Bus is an inter-process communication (IPC) message bus. It provides a
  channel through which system services and applications talk to each other.
  Nearly every desktop service depends on it: NetworkManager, elogind,
  Bluetooth (bluez), polkit, PipeWire, and most GUI apps all communicate
  over D-Bus. Without dbus running, most desktop software will fail to start
  or behave incorrectly.

  After install, the runit service is at /etc/sv/dbus.

when_to_use:
  Server:  Only if a running service requires it (e.g. NetworkManager does).
  Desktop: Yes — always. Enable it before elogind, NetworkManager, etc.

conflicts:
  None.

server: CONDITIONAL (yes if NetworkManager or bluez are used)
